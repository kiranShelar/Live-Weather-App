Easy to use live weather forcast app built using Nodejs!

Based on fetching live weather forecast from Openweathermap API using express library.

Instead of responding with text when user inputs desired location, weather app respond with an rendered template page. For this app, HBS (Handlebars) is used as a templating engine.

A template engine enables you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client. This approach makes it easier to design an HTML page.

Feel free to provide your inputs for new feature deployment.

Thankyou!
